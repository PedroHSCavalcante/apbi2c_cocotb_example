This is an example testbench using **cocotb** framework for **apbi2c** controller from freecores.
The intention is to present advanced metric-driven and constrained-random functional verification techniques using pure Python-based implementation.
No support of hardware verification languages such as e or SystemVerilog is required, which enables use of an arbitrary basic HDL simulator for the entire verification process.
